## 📖 Introduction
Welcome to the **airflow-demo** project! This application helps you learn Apache Airflow by providing a runnable Docker Compose setup. You will find several demo Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that cover essential topics such as scheduling, retries, branching, sensors, datasets, templating, and dynamic task mapping.

## 🌟 Features
- **Simple Setup:** Quickly get started with Docker Compose.
- **Focused Demos:** Explore various aspects of Airflow through practical examples.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Navigate easily with an intuitive workflow.
- **Real-World Scenarios:** Learn how to orchestrate data pipelines effectively.

## 💻 System Requirements
- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Docker:** Ensure that Docker is installed. You can download it from [Docker's official site](https://www.docker.com/).
- **Docker Compose:** This should come with your Docker installation. Verify it's included by running `docker-compose --version` in your terminal.
