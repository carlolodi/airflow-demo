# Extra Python dependencies for this demo Airflow image.
#
# Notes:
# - Airflow itself is provided by the base Docker image (see Dockerfile).
# - Add provider packages here as you introduce integrations (Postgres, HTTP APIs, etc.).
# - Keep this file small and intentional; prefer providers over ad-hoc clients when available.
